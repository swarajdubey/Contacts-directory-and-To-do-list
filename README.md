# Contacts-directory-and-To-do-list

This is a Java GUI application that helps users to manage their contacts directory and also has a to do list feature.
The application is also able to check for any duplicates or invalid entries hence making the system robust

Improvements:
- A much better looking GUI
- More features apart from To-do list and contacts directory management
- "UPDATE" query has some bugs, at times it does not update correctly to the database and hence runs into an exception.
